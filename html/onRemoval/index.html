    <p><button id="remButton">Remove</button></p>
    <p id="rem1">text</p>
    <p id="rem2"><a href="https://example.com">link</a></p>
    <p>To be able to observe this case easily, use really short deadline:</p>
    <pre><code>this.flushQueue({ timeRemaining: () => 0 });</code></pre>
    <p>
      At first, this page should have 2 clickable elements. After clicking on
      the Remove button, it should have 1 clicklable element. Check the
      performance section in the options page!
    </p>
    <p>
      This case is tricky because the link is removed from the paragraph after
      the paragraph has already been removed from the DOM, but before weâ€™ve had
      a chance to run <code>.querySelectorAll("*")</code> on it. This is why we
      need to observe all removed nodes with a separate MutationObserver until
      the queue has been flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The case does only seem to trigger if clicking the button with the
      <em>mouse.</em>
